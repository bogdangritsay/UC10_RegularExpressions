Create a function implementing the regular expression validation according to the defined acceptance criteria. The function should accept the string to match and return the Boolean matching result.

Compose a function with a single regular expression that successfully meets requirements below:
•	This regular expression should validate the maximum string length (passed as parameter); it should return a match if the string length is within the acceptable range and a non-match if it is not.
•	This regular expression should also validate that the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~. It should return a match if the criteria are met and a non-match if they are not.
•	This regular expression should validate that the string does not contain any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). This should return a non-match if any whitespace characters are found.
•	The regular expression should be optimized for execution speed and simplicity. The regular expression should still fulfill all the above criteria.
•	The regular expression should be tested in code on a variety of sample inputs and edge cases (10) to ensure the regex is functioning properly.
•	The regular expression should be implemented within the code in a way that it can be easily reused for various inputs.
•	Implementation should not introduce any unexpected behavior or bugs.
•	Clear and concise documentation should be provided for the regular expression, explaining how it works, and any caveats or limitations.

Let's break down the requirements and implement the solution step by step.

Step 1: Define the Regular Expression
To match all the criteria:

Maximum string length is parameterized.
Contains at least one uppercase letter: [A-Z]
Contains at least one lowercase letter: [a-z]
Contains at least one digit: \d
Contains at least one special character from the list: [\Q!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~\E]`
No whitespace characters: We will ensure this by using ^ and $ to mark the start and end of the line.
Using positive lookaheads, we can create the following regular expression:

regex
Copy code
^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\Q!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~\E])(?!.*\s).{1,PARAMETERIZED_LENGTH}$
Step 2: Implement the Java Function
java
Copy code
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class RegexValidator {
    private static final String SPECIAL_CHARACTERS = "\\Q!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\\E";

    public static boolean validateString(String str, int maxLength) {
        String regex = "^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[" + SPECIAL_CHARACTERS + "])(?!.*\\s).{1," + maxLength + "}$";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
        return pattern.matcher(str).matches();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        String[] tests = {
            "Aa1!",        // True: Meets all criteria
            "Aa1! ",       // False: Contains whitespace
            "Aa!",         // False: Missing digit
            "aa1!",        // False: Missing uppercase
            "AA1!",        // False: Missing lowercase
            "Aab!",        // False: Missing digit
            "Aa1b",        // False: Missing special character
            "Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!Aa1!", // False: Exceeds maxLength
            "Aa1!Aa1",     // True: Meets all criteria
            "Aa1!@#",      // True: Meets all criteria
        };
        int maxLength = 20;
        for (String test : tests) {
            System.out.println(validateString(test, maxLength));
        }
    }
}
Step 3: Documentation
Regular Expression Explanation:
^: Denotes the beginning of the line.
(?=.*[A-Z]): Positive lookahead for one uppercase letter.
(?=.*[a-z]): Positive lookahead for one lowercase letter.
(?=.*\d): Positive lookahead for one digit.
(?=.*[SPECIAL_CHARACTERS]): Positive lookahead for one special character from the predefined list.
(?!.*\s): Negative lookahead to ensure there's no whitespace character in the string.
.{1,PARAMETERIZED_LENGTH}$: Ensures the length of the string is between 1 and the given maximum length (inclusive).
$: Denotes the end of the line.
Caveats and Limitations:
The minimum valid string length is 4 since it needs at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, and one special character.
The maximum valid string length is specified by the maxLength parameter.
The list of special characters is predefined and should not be changed without updating the regular expression accordingly.
